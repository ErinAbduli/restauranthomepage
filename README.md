Projekt HTML, CSS, SASS(OPCIONAL)

Pots and Mussels is the first stop of the street delicacies we established under the name of Seyyarhane. We produce mussels, which we receive live from farms approved by the relevant ministry, in accordance with the Turkish Food Codex and "daily" and ship them to our branches.

In addition to the traditional taste, we bring a new breath to the street cuisine with our different recipes, always hot, fresh and cooked specially for you whenever you want.
